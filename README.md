## What if…

…you could put Pokémon to work when they’re in the Pasture Block?

## Features

- Adds the Pasture Bin, which collects drops from Pokémon in immediately adjacent Pasture Blocks.
    - The Pasture Bin has an interface to interact with its inventory. There are 4 slots for items to be collected into. Players cannot put items into the slots, but they can take items out via the slots.
    - The Pasture Bin can have its inventory piped out via hopper.
- The drops collected via the Pasture Bin fall back to the same drops you get when you catch/defeat the Pokémon by default. There is extensive datapackability for this, using the [Drop Loot Tables](https://www.notion.so/Drop-Loot-Tables-21d57e0d4afd80809bbbf3c38975664e?pvs=21) logic.

## Dependencies

- [Cobblemon](https://www.notion.so/Cobblemon-22157e0d4afd80a49896c70a775a3c7f?pvs=21)
- [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://www.notion.so/Fabric-Language-Kotlin-22157e0d4afd80b69919e8540208081b?pvs=21)/[Kotlin for Forge](https://www.notion.so/Kotlin-For-Forge-22157e0d4afd80799f2dd0a63e8ecdbb?pvs=21)

## Testing

Give yourself a PC from Cobblemon. Give yourself a Pokémon. Put the Pokémon in the PC. Give yourself a Pasture Block and a Pasture Bin. Place the Pasture Block down, and place the Pasture Bin immediately adjacent to it (no diagonals, no Y-level difference, just right next to it). Open the Pasture Block’s interface by interacting with it, and add the Pokémon you placed in the PC into the Pasture Block. To speed things up, run `/gamerule randomTick 300`. You should see some particles above the Pasture Bin, indicating a drop has been collected. Open the Pasture Bin by interacting with it to see the drops that have been collected so far.
